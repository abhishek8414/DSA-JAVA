In Java, String interning is a way to store only one copy of each distinct string value in memory — to save space and improve performance.

🧩 What is String Interning?

When you create strings in Java, they can either:
Be stored in the String Pool (a special memory area inside the heap), or Be stored as a new object in the heap.
 The String Pool keeps only one copy of each literal string.
